# Media Widget

This media widget can embed image, audio, video and iframe elements solely with their corresponding tags (`<img>`, `<audio>`, `<video>` and `<iframe>`) or wrapped within a `<figure>` when used with a caption.

In case the media element is wrapped within a `figure` element, this widget will add the CSS class `image`, `audio`, `video` or `iframe` to the `figure` element. It also supports alignment by setting an appropriate CSS class (`left` or `right`), and the attributes `width`, `height` and `alt`. The `controls`(audio and video) and `allowfullscreen` (iframe) are automatically set.

If you have installed a file browser that uses the API of the [mediabrowser add-on](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mediabrowser) or the [filebrowser add-on](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/filebrowser), the _Browse server_ button will appear. This widget itself does not provide any file browser.

No configuration necessary.

## Usage with the [mediabrowser add-on](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mediabrowser)

If you use the [mediabrowser add-on](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mediabrowser), your media browser implementation can currently send following keys with the message:

    {
        alt: 'Alternative text', // optional
        src: '/url/to/media', //required
        type: 'image' // optional, one of audio, iframe, image or video
    }
