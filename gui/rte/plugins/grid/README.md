# Grid Widget

This widgets just serves as a container for multiple instances of other widgets in order to apply certain styles on them, p.e. through flexbox or grid layout.

The resulting HTML will be

    <div class="grid">
        ...
    </div>

## Note

Currently only *figure*, *section* and [*block*](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/block) elements are allowed as child elements. This artificial limitation will be removed in one of the next versions.
