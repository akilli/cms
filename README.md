A quick'n'dirty non-OOP-experiment... or something completely different.

## Setup

Check the docker-compose.yml file as one possible solution. It is using an external network `proxy` and [traefik](https://traefik.io/) as reverse proxy. Both is not needed, so adjust to your needs.

Run the docker containers and access with configured domain. You can log in via URL `/account/login` with name `admin` and password `password`.
